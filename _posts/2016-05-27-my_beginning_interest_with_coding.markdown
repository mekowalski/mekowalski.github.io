I began looking into becoming a programmer for two reasons: Karlie Kloss and where I live.

I was going through a moment where nothing was changing.  This was neither good nor bad it was just unproductive and boring.  I managed a women's clothing boutique and I loved what I did there.  I was creative with selecting clothes and accessories to bring in.  I was creative with how to display the store to keep customers interested.  I was creative on window displays, especially when there was a holiday or town event going on.  This all helped me express my creativity in a fun environment.  I also had a great social setting that being relating with customers, helping them find the perfect heels to go with their outfit and helping them explore options they had yet to consider.  While this was all good, I had reach my highest potential of management at the boutique.  This is where I stopped growing as an indivual and as a professional.

At the boutique we displayed many different magazines for customers to browse.  One of which was a Glamour magazine with Karlie Kloss on the cover.  Being immersed in fashion, I knew who she was: a model the world knew but that's all I knew.  I picked up the magazine mainly to look at photographed editorials and maybe read an article or two, then I came across Karlie's interview with Glamour.  She touched on many topics but what struck me was her enthusiasm with coding.  I was kind of surprised and even more interested with her at this point.  But what she spoke of, empowering young women with coding, made me think of how I can contribute into a community and also help others grow.  This kindled a new idea for me, an idea that I had been looking for while stagnant at my position.  While at work, during slow moments, I would browse online fashion streams and one was Elle magazine.  I, again, came across Karlie, coding and a new venture.  The venture of coding fully at your own pace with a young, successful school, FlatIron School.  That's when my kindling became a small ignite for new adventures.

I am always up for new adventures.  They help you grow, take to places, let you breathe in new perspectives.  I have this mindset because of where I live.

I reside in the mountains in Southwest Colorado.  I have been inspired and fortunate to live in a gorgeous area where you are surrounded by beauty.  With this beauty comes many adventures, seasons and challenges.  I wanted to dive into programming to better myself, challenge my intellectual strengths to be a better individual and worker.  I have been fortunate to live in a place while working one job.  But because of working one job, I have also reached my highest potential where I am unable to grow myself.  Therefore I began seeking coding because, as I have already encountered, it has been a new adventure.  A great challenge, I am so excited when I learn something new.  I share it with those around me and they can see my excitement on learning an entirely new language that is already developing my life for the better.  I want to become a programmer to seek new adventures, meet new faces and offer my personal insights to those I meet.  This has been a new interest that has revived my passion for life, I cannot quit thinking about it and I want to be fully immersed in it.  I mean how else do you learn a foreign tongue if you're not fully in the culture?  I'm ready to dig into a new culture.
